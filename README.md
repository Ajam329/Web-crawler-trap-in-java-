**Web Crawler Trap in Java - SpiderTrapServer**

The SpiderTrapServer is a Java program designed to create a web crawler trap. A web crawler trap is a mechanism employed to identify and manage web crawlers that may be indexing web content excessively, causing potential issues such as bandwidth consumption and server load. The SpiderTrapServer generates dynamic web pages with varying links, aiming to ensnare web crawlers that follow links endlessly without adding meaningful content to their indexes.

**Features:**

1. **Configuration Section:**
   - Parameters such as the minimum and maximum number of links per page, the length of links, and character space for link generation can be adjusted to customize the trap's behavior.

2. **Page Generation:**
   - The `SpiderTrapHandler` generates HTML pages dynamically, each containing a random number of links within the specified range.
   - Links have random lengths and are created from a character space defined in the configuration.

3. **Delay Mechanism:**
   - The server introduces a delay of 350 milliseconds before responding to requests. This delay is a common technique to identify and slow down web crawlers.

4. **Page Count Tracking:**
   - The server maintains a count of how many times a particular page (identified by its seed) has been opened.
   - If a page is opened 100 times, the server prints a message indicating potential excessive crawling.

**How to Use:**

1. **Compile and Run:**
   - Compile the `SpiderTrapServer` class.
   - Run the compiled class to start the server.

2. **Server Startup:**
   - The server starts on port 8000.
   - A message indicates that the server has started and provides instructions to stop it using Ctrl+C.

3. **Web Crawling:**
   - Web crawlers accessing pages from this server may get trapped due to the dynamic link generation and delay mechanisms.

4. **Monitoring:**
   - The server monitors the count of page openings and notifies when a page has been opened 100 times.

**Note:**
   - This SpiderTrapServer is a simple example and may not be foolproof against advanced web crawlers.
   - For practical usage, consider integrating additional techniques, such as IP rate limiting and user-agent analysis.

**Important:**
   - Web crawler traps should be used responsibly and comply with legal and ethical standards. Excessive trapping or malicious use may violate terms of service and can lead to legal consequences.
